			<p>Southern California Edison is a major supporter of Hope Through Education, not only through company donations, but they also provide incentives for their employees to donate and volunteer. Their new Community Grant program expands Edison’s giving to support more   grassroots organizations. The Community Grant program, which provides   grants up to $5,000 per year, was established to help a wide range   of organizations whose missions and programs fall within their four   investment areas. </p>
			<p>Their philosophy of investment is centered on the thought that all people   should have the opportunity to fulfill their dreams. While tackling critical issues, they consciously do so with an eye to how these efforts   can assist, in particular, the underserved population comprised of:   ethnic groups, seniors, disabled, women, low income, gay and lesbian.   Over 70% of all California contributions were directed to underserved   communities during the past three years. They will continue to focus on   this population for years to come. The diversity of those they serve is   also critical as to how they shape  community investments. As they seek   solutions to society’s challenges, it is the great determination and   diversity of everyone working together, that will help make our   communities a better place to live, work and prosper.
