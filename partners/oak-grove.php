          <p>Oak Grove works with children &amp; adolescents whose needs and problems can be quite complex. One of our greatest assets lies in the sophistication and experience level of a team of clinicians comprised of psychiatrists and licensed independent practitioners (MFT, LCSW, Psy. D), as well as our nursing staff, behavior intervention specialists led by a Board Certified Behavior Analyst, fully credentialed special education teachers, &amp; milieu and activities staff.</p>
